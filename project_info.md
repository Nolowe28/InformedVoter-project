The purpose of this project is to:
1. Help me practice my skills in web development, using The Odin Project as a guide.
2. Deliver information about politicians currently in office or planning to run for office in a manner which is interactive and easy to navigate. 


The inspiration for this project comes from a personal, existential analysis of the current disconnect in the way people learn today compared to how we are taught in school. The way school is structured has not changed much, specifically how the information is delivered. This is a major problem as education is vital for human life to sustain its creation of modern day society. Education seems to be the first thing cut in the government's budget when times are hard in the economic sector. This overall neglect of the way we educate our citizens and the insufficient funding public schools receive is creating a society of easily manipulated, ill-informed, shallow minded groups of individuals, unable to have civil discussions on matters of disagreements. 

    So, seeing how I value education, I feel it is an obligation of mine to 
not only talk about how important it is, but to be actively involved in the creation of a new way to educate. This is a tall task for one person to achieve on their own obviously, and being that I am one person, I decided I needed to focus on one small part and grow it from there. It is a belief of mine that one of the most important things to educate ones self on is who is in charge and how do they represent the population, so this is where I will start.

    I want to create an app that is able to inform U.S. voters and citizens
in general on the views and plans of political leaders currently in office and those planning to run/running. Being that all the information needed for an app like this is already accessible online and on social media, the purpose of this app will be to consolidate and present the information in a way that makes it interesting.
This will explain what I mean by interesting:

Start from the user experience:
* Why would anyone care about opening your app at all?
* How will people hear about your app?
* What kind of conversations could lead to someone mentioning your app?
